## Reporting a Vulnerability

The GitHub Security Pipeline team takes all security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Issue

**DO NOT** file a public GitHub issue about security vulnerabilities. 

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing our security team at:

**security-pipeline-security@example.com**

Please include the following information in your report:

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Potential impact of the vulnerability
4. Suggested mitigation or remediation if available
5. Your name and contact information (for attribution, if desired)

### What to Expect

After receiving your report, our security team will:

1. **Acknowledge** receipt of your vulnerability report within 24 hours
2. **Assess** the impact and severity of the reported issue
3. **Investigate** and work on a fix
4. **Release** an update that addresses the vulnerability
5. **Disclose** the vulnerability after it has been fixed

### Disclosure Policy

- Security vulnerabilities will be addressed with the highest priority
- We aim to release fixes for critical security issues within 7 days
- We will credit security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities if they wish
- Public disclosure will be coordinated with the reporter

## Security Updates

Security updates are published through:

1. GitHub Security Advisories
2. Release notes in our [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
3. Security announcements on our [official website](https://security-pipeline.example.com/security)

## Best Practices

We recommend the following security best practices when using GitHub Security Pipeline:

### Authentication Security

- Use fine-grained personal access tokens with minimum required permissions
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Store tokens securely using GitHub Secrets or a secure vault
- Enable 2FA for all GitHub accounts

### Configuration Security

- Review automatically generated security rules before committing
- Store sensitive configuration separately from code
- Use environment variables for runtime configuration
- Validate configuration file permissions

### Integration Security

- Review external services connected to your repositories
- Audit GitHub Apps and OAuth permissions regularly
- Limit webhook endpoints to trusted services
- Verify webhook signatures

## Security Features

The GitHub Security Pipeline includes several security features:

1. **Secret Detection**: Prevents accidental exposure of tokens, passwords, and keys
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Identifies vulnerabilities in dependencies
3. **Code Quality Analysis**: Detects security anti-patterns
4. **Configuration Validation**: Ensures secure configurations
5. **Pull Request Analysis**: Reviews changes for security issues

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the following security researchers for their valuable contributions to the security of this project:

- Alex Security ([@alexsec](https://github.com/alexsec)) - Responsible disclosure of token handling vulnerability
- Secure Coder ([@securecoder](https://github.com/securecoder)) - Improvements to secret scanning patterns
- Pentest Pro ([@pentestpro](https://github.com/pentestpro)) - Identifying a permission escalation risk

## Security Development Lifecycle

This project follows a security development lifecycle that includes:

1. Security requirements and threat modeling
2. Security design reviews
3. Static and dynamic code analysis
4. Third-party dependency reviews
5. Penetration testing
6. Security response planning
