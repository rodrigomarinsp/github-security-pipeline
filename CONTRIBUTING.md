## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that all participants are expected to follow. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to security-pipeline-maintainers@example.com.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Before creating a bug report:

1. **Check the issue tracker** to see if the bug has already been reported
2. **Use the provided bug report template** when creating a new issue
3. **Provide detailed information** including:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Exact steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Screenshots or logs (redacted of sensitive information)
   - Environment details (OS, GitHub version, etc.)
   - Potential workarounds if known

### Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the feature request template** for new suggestions
3. **Be specific about the problem** the feature would solve
4. **Provide mockups or examples** if applicable
5. **Consider scope and compatibility** with the project's goals

### Improving Documentation

Documentation improvements are vital to the project:

1. **Identify gaps or unclear sections** in existing documentation
2. **Follow documentation standards** outlined below
3. **Submit documentation-only PRs** separate from code changes
4. **Include examples and context** for better understanding
5. **Consider multiple audience levels** (beginner, intermediate, advanced)

### Contributing Code

Code contributions are welcome through pull requests:

1. **Start with small contributions** to become familiar with the project
2. **Discuss major changes** in an issue before implementing
3. **Follow the [pull request process](#pull-request-process)**
4. **Adhere to [coding standards](#coding-standards)**
5. **Include tests** for new functionality
6. **Update documentation** to reflect changes

## Development Environment

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/github-security-pipeline.git
   cd github-security-pipeline
   ```
3. **Set up the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-org/github-security-pipeline.git
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
5. **Set up pre-commit hooks**:

- **Formatting**: black, prettier
- **Testing**: pytest, github-actions-runner
- **Documentation**: mkdocs, sphinx

## Pull Request Process

### Submission Guidelines

1. **Create a feature branch** from the main branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards
3. **Commit with clear messages** following conventional commits:
   ```
   type(scope): brief description
   
   Longer description explaining the change and its motivation.
   
   Fixes #123
   ```
4. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Submit a pull request** against the main branch

### Code Review Process

1. **Maintainers will review** your pull request
2. **Address review comments** promptly
3. **CI checks must pass** before merging
